Hello , my name is Priyansh Sharma currently doing B.tech in CSE.
This is the project I have created as a task given by a comapany for the role of front-end developer intern.
In this project , I have used NextJS framework for front-end and TailwindCSS fro overall layout design.
I have also implemented various animations in this website using framer-motion package , which further increases the website's attractiveness and overall look and feel.
You can clone this repository in you local to try this website in you local system or you can go to the deployed website address : task-density.vercel.app
